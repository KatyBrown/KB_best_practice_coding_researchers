## Pep8 Exercise

#### 👥 Small Group Activity

The code in ['code_exercises/wrc_pep8_exercise.py']('../../code_exercises/wrc_pep8_exercise.py') 
defines a new class "FLUFFYDOG" and three functions.
These functions:
    * Check how many words are in the dog's name
    * Check the name for whitespace
    * Check the name for punctuation
The result of running each function is printed to the screen.

The code works but it contains a number of pep8, style and consistency issues.
Try to find and correct these issues. Don't worry about improving the comments
or docstrings, they are just to explain how the code works. For this exercise
there's also no need to improve how the code functions, except to make it
consistent.

Corrected code is available as ['code_exercises/wrc_pep8_exercise_corrected.py']('../../code_exercises/wrc_pep8_exercise_corrected.py') but your
answer may differ. All of the changes made are listed in
['code_exercises/wrc_pep8_exercise_corrected_annotated.py']('../../code_exercises/wrc_pep8_exercise_corrected_annotated.py').
